Objective
This repository hosts a Django-based application designed for data analytics enthusiasts interested in exploring flight prices through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictions using a linear regression model. The primary objective is to provide users with valuable insights into flight price trends and facilitate predictions based on historical data.

About the Data Set
The project utilizes a comprehensive flight price dataset for analysis and prediction. The dataset includes various parameters such as departure and arrival locations, date and time, airline information, and, most importantly, the corresponding flight prices. This dataset forms the backbone of our analytical and predictive efforts.
