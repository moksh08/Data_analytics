## About the Data Set

The project utilizes a comprehensive flight price dataset for analysis and prediction. The dataset includes various parameters such as departure and arrival locations, date and time, airline information, and, most importantly, the corresponding flight prices. This dataset forms the backbone of our analytical and predictive efforts.
